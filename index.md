# Recipes for Transportation Demand Data Analysis

This is my "cookbook" of various scripts, tidbits of knowledge, and other stuff that 
I've cobbled together and re-use constantly or rarely. These are either easy-to-understand 
"recipes" for doing something or a quick summary explainer about something.

There are a few parts to this "cookbook".

Data Input and Output: Recipes about getting transportation data into or out 
of Python or R.

Data Manipulation: Recipes to Prepare or Manipulate Data

Data Analysis: Recipes for analysis of data

Data Visualization: Recipes for the presentation of data and analysis

Geopandas: Recipes using Geopandas to prepare data for geographic analysis or do geoprocessing.

Machine Learning: Recipes using machine learning that isn't as common in travel demand modeling.

Python Design: Recipes about Python Design
